# Calories Tracker 🥗

**Track calories. Not subscriptions.**

This app was built out of frustration with calorie trackers that force paid plans within days.

No ads.  
No subscriptions.  
No login.  
No cloud storage.

Just install and start tracking.

## 🚀 Why this exists

Most calorie tracking apps:
- Lock features behind paywalls
- Force sign-ups
- Store your data on their servers
- Push subscriptions aggressively

I didn’t want any of that.

So I built a **no-bullshit calorie tracker** that:
- Works offline
- Requires zero personal details
- Stores everything locally on your device

Your data **never leaves your device**.

2. Tap **“Add to Home Screen”**
